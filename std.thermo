# @ means allocate 64 bit number and read in pointer address at value for 64 bit number
# ! means dump memory address into current cell
# ~ means deallocate memory address in pointer address buffer
# & means read in current cell into pointer address buffer
# | means jump to pointer address' cell
# * takes you to cell 0 
# ** skips to the next cell with value * or 0 if not found
# / adds a cell with value 0 after the current cell
# \{x} copies a 64 bit number x into the current cell
# $ copies the number in the current cell to a copy value buffer
# ^ copies the number in the copy value buffer into the current cell
# , prints the number in the current copy value buffer to the terminal in ASCII
# ; prints the number in the current copy value buffer to the terminal
# () are the same as [] expect () loops until the value in the function operand buffer = 0
# %% encapsulates math operations done on the function operand buffer, +-$^,; are allowed in between %% 

# <>+-[] are the other supported bf operations

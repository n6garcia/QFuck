# Thermo

A new TM compiler designed by me to have only 2 bit numbers.

4 numeric symbols are 0+-*

0++ = * /

*+ = 0 / 

0-- = * / 

*- = 0 / 

0- = - / 

0+ = + / 

+- = 0 / 

-+ = 0 /

My Current Plan is to attempt to develop x44-48 and x92-96 on top of Thermo. (QTPU?)

The idea is that sets of 2 bit words should be the last extension to CPU architecture.

Hopefully ARM will die to RISC-V architecture but x44-48 will be optimized for mobile devices.

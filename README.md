# ThermoFuck

A new BrainFuck compiler designed by me to have only 4 bit numbers.

4 numeric symbols are 0+-* ...

0++ = *

*+ = 0

0-- = *

*- = 0

0- = -

0+ = +

+- = 0

-+ = 0

My Current Plan is to attempt to develop x44-48 and x92-96 on top of BrainFuck.

The idea is that sets of 4 bit words should be the last extension to CPU architecture.

Arm will die to RISC-V architecture but x44-48 will be optimized for mobile devices.
